vimrc

My .vimrc file
Mainly set for vi compatibility.

The standard doesn't do well lately.
- The colors are horrible
- Inserting characters and ESC print odd characters.  

TODO:  Research the different syntax color schemes.
       colorscheme COLOR_SCHEME_NAME
       where COLOR_SCHEME_NAME can be
       default,blue,darkblue,delek,desert,elford,evening,industry,
       koehler,morning,murphy,pablo,peachpuff,ron,shine,slate,torte,zellner
