vimrc
=====

My .vimrc file  
Mainly set for vi compatibility.

The initial upload in 2014 was:
```bash
set nohlsearch
set noai
set nolist
set ffs=unix
```
My standard file doesn't do well lately.
- The colors are horrible
- Inserting characters and ESC print odd characters.
  - This seems to be due to the different vim versions used by the different Ubuntu versions.

TODO  
       Research the different syntax color schemes.  
       colorscheme COLOR_SCHEME_NAME  
       where COLOR_SCHEME_NAME can be:  
       default,blue,darkblue,delek,desert,elford,evening,industry,  
       koehler,morning,murphy,pablo,peachpuff,ron,shine,slate,torte,zellner
